Git Branches

---

## `Head`

- `Head`: the current "location" in the repository. It points to a particular branch reference.
  - "Bookmark" in a book, (only one is active).
  - **Head** only points to the branch. (eg. HEAD -> Master)
  - **Branch** points to the newest commit.

## Commands

- `git branch`
  - Active branch: `*` (currently on)
- `git branch <branch-name>` (no space): Only makes a new branch, does not switch to the new branch.
